# 🛠️ Beyond-LLVM Roadmap
_“From Dependence to Autonomy — A Practical Path to the Post-LLVM Era.”_

---

## 📍 Phase 0 — Foundation (Now)
> Establish the philosophical and structural backbone.

**Goals**
- Define the core principles in `PHILOSOPHY.md` and `VISION.md`.  
- Create minimal repository structure (`docs/`, `prototypes/`, `specs/`).  
- Align terminology across the ecosystem: R3C, HalRust, LLVM-Zero.  
- Identify LLVM pain points (IR volatility, build overhead, hidden passes).  

**Deliverables**
- `bllvm_concepts.md`  
- `llvm_dependency_analysis.md`  
- Whitepaper outline for Post-LLVM compiler philosophy.  

---

## ⚙️ Phase 1 — Compatibility (Q1–Q2 2026)
> “Coexistence before independence.”

**Goals**
- Establish a **thin compatibility layer** for LLVM-based compilers.  
- Implement a **minimal IR adapter** that can read/write LLVM IR while detaching from its internal APIs.  
- Validate through **HalRust**’s dual-mode compilation (LLVM / Pure ASM).  

**Deliverables**
- `prototypes/ir_adapter.rs`  
- `tests/llvm_bridge_validation.rs`  
- Documentation: `docs/COMPAT_LAYER.md`  

---

## 🔧 Phase 2 — Hybrid Adaptation (Q3–Q4 2026)
> “Transition by layering, not by breaking.”

**Goals**
- Design the **Beyond Intermediate Representation (BIR)**.  
- Create hybrid compiler backends that can switch between LLVM and BIR.  
- Launch `bllvm-ir-sandbox` repository for experimental passes.  
- Begin cross-testing with R3C pipeline and HalRust.

**Deliverables**
- `specs/bllvm_ir_spec.md`  
- `prototypes/bir_pipeline.rs`  
- Integration report: `research/llvm_vs_bir_analysis.md`  

---

## 🧩 Phase 3 — Autonomy (2027)
> “The compiler must learn to breathe on its own.”

**Goals**
- Achieve full code emission via BIR → ASM without LLVM involvement.  
- Implement minimal transparent optimizers (pattern-based, not opaque passes).  
- Begin reproducibility testing across OS and architectures.  

**Deliverables**
- `prototypes/asm_emitter.rs`  
- `tests/reproducibility_suite/`  
- Paper: “The Case for Compiler Autonomy.”  

---

## 🚀 Phase 4 — Transcendence (2028–2029)
> “LLVM was the bridge; now we walk without it.”

**Goals**
- Release a stable **Post-LLVM reference compiler**.  
- Integrate with educational and embedded contexts (R3C-based SDK).  
- Publish the Beyond-LLVM whitepaper and open technical specs.  
- Formalize community governance under the “Autonomous Compiler Alliance (ACA).”

**Deliverables**
- `BeyondLLVM-1.0` release  
- `docs/WHITEPAPER.md`  
- `specs/bir_standard_v1.md`  
- `academy/` — educational sandbox + public lecture material  

---

## 🌌 Long-Term Vision — Post-LLVM Civilization (2030+)
> “Freedom, once regained, must be maintained.”

- Self-hosting compilers that compile their own IR.  
- Industry adoption for transparent pipelines.  
- Coexistence with LLVM, GCC, and WASM ecosystems.  
- Use Beyond-LLVM as a foundation for academic curricula.  
- Establish a unified open IR registry for decentralized toolchains.

## 🧭 Ecosystem Interlink
| Project | Role | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| **R3C** | LLVM-free C++→Rust→ASM Core | Active |
| **HalRust** | Hybrid Layer Bridge (LLVM ↔ ASM) | Active |
| **LLVM-Zero** | Philosophical & transitional framework | Active |
| **Beyond-LLVM** | Vision, coordination, and research hub | Core |

## 🧠 Core Principle Recap
> - Dependence is comfort.  
> - Independence is evolution.  
> - Transparency is civilization.  

---

**Beyond-LLVM** is not a fork of history —  
it is the **next chapter** of compiler civilization.

**→ Prepare. Transcend. Sustain.**
