# 🚀 Beyond-LLVM  
**Prepare the Post-LLVM Era**  
> “We are not replacing LLVM — we are preparing what comes after.”

---

## 🧭 Overview  
**Beyond-LLVM** is a conceptual and philosophical hub dedicated to reimagining the compiler ecosystem *after* LLVM.  

It complements the **LLVM-Zero-Ecosystem**, focusing not on implementation, but on **direction, vision, and philosophy** — a space to explore how future compilers can become **self-hosting**, **stable**, and **sustainable**.

---

## 🎯 Mission — Prepare the Post-LLVM Era  

- Define what “post-LLVM” truly means for language ecosystems.  
- Propose a new generation of **self-sufficient, deterministic compilers**.  
- Build bridges between languages (**C++ ↔ Rust ↔ ASM**) without LLVM.  
- Inspire long-term compiler design for **security**, **reproducibility**, and **openness**.

## 🧱 Ecosystem Context  

Beyond-LLVM provides the **high-level vision** guiding the LLVM-free projects:

| Project | Role | Focus |
|----------|------|--------|
| **R3C** | Compiler | LLVM-Free Self-Hosting |
| **R4W** | Web Runtime | Run LLVM-Free on Web |
| **R5S** | Security | Sustainable & Verified |
| **R6I** | IoT Runtime | Run in Devices |
| **LLVM-Zero-Ecosystem** | Spec | Technical Architecture |

---

## 🪶 Philosophy  

> LLVM built the present.  
> Beyond-LLVM prepares the future.  

The future of compilers isn’t about **fighting LLVM** —  
it’s about **learning from it**, **outgrowing it**, and **evolving beyond it**.  

This project is not an opposition — it’s a **graduation**.

## 🧭 Roadmap  

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | Publish `VISION.md` — Philosophical declaration |
| **Phase 2** | Write `FUTURE.md` — Post-LLVM design directions |
| **Phase 3** | Link **Beyond-LLVM** ↔ **LLVM-Zero-Ecosystem** documentation |
| **Phase 4** | Open discussions, essays, and whitepapers |
