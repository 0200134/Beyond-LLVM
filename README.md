# 🚀 Beyond-LLVM  
### *Prepare the Post-LLVM Era.*

> “We are not replacing LLVM — we are preparing what comes after.”

---

## 🧭 Overview
**Beyond-LLVM** is a conceptual and philosophical hub  
dedicated to designing the **compiler ecosystem after LLVM**.  

It complements the [LLVM-Zero-Ecosystem](https://github.com/0200134/LLVM-Zero-Ecosystem),  
focusing not on implementation but on **direction, vision, and philosophy** —  
a space to explore how future compilers can be self-hosting, stable, and sustainable.

---

## 🎯 Mission — *Prepare the Post-LLVM Era*
- Define what “post-LLVM” truly means for language ecosystems.  
- Propose a new generation of **self-sufficient, deterministic compilers.**  
- Build bridges between languages (C++ ↔ Rust ↔ ASM) without LLVM.  
- Inspire long-term compiler design for **security, reproducibility, and openness.**

## 🧱 Ecosystem Context
Beyond-LLVM provides the high-level vision guiding the LLVM-free projects:  
| Project | Role | Focus |
|----------|------|-------|
| [R3C](https://github.com/0200134/r3c) | Compiler | LLVM-Free Self-Hosting |
| [R4W](https://github.com/0200134/R4W) | Web Runtime | Run LLVM-Free on Web |
| [R5S](https://github.com/0200134/R5S) | Security | Sustainable & Verified |
| [R6I](https://github.com/0200134/R6I) | IoT Runtime | Run *in* Devices |
| [LLVM-Zero-Ecosystem](https://github.com/0200134/LLVM-Zero-Ecosystem) | Spec | Technical Architecture |

## 🪶 Philosophy
> LLVM built the present.  
> Beyond-LLVM prepares the future.  

The future of compilers isn’t about fighting LLVM —  
it’s about **learning from it, outgrowing it, and evolving beyond it.**

---

## 🧭 Roadmap
| Phase | Focus |
|-------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | Publish VISION.md — philosophical declaration |
| **Phase 2** | Write FUTURE.md — Post-LLVM design directions |
| **Phase 3** | Link Beyond-LLVM ↔ LLVM-Zero documentation |
| **Phase 4** | Open discussions, essays, and whitepapers |
